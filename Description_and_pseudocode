1. Start
2. Define a list called RPS containing 'rock' (r), 'paper' (p), and 'scissors' (s)
3. Define a function called points():
    a. Ask the user for how many points they want to play the game
    b. Return the value entered by the user
4. Define a function called user():
    a. Ask the user to enter their choice: rock, paper, or scissors
    b. Convert the input to lowercase
    c. If the choice is not valid, ask the user to enter again until a valid choice is made
    d. Return the user's choice
5. Define a function called computer():
    a. Randomly select a choice from the list RPS
    b. Return the computer's choice
6. Define a function called play():
    a. Display instructions for the game
    b. Call the points() function to get the target points for winning
    c. Initialize variables Up (user points) and Cp (computer points) to 0
    d. Start a loop that continues until either Up or Cp reaches the target points:
        i. Call the user() function to get the user's choice
        ii. Call the computer() function to get the computer's choice
        iii. Compare the choices and determine the winner of the round:
            - If the user wins, increment Up by 1
            - If it's a tie, no one gets a point
            - If the computer wins, increment Cp by 1
        iv. Display the computer's choice and the current points of both the user and the computer
    e. Once the loop ends, determine the overall winner based on who reached the target points first
    f. Print the winner
7. If the program is run directly (not imported into another module), call the play() function to start the game
8. End
